# Video-Annotation-and-Characterization
In this exercise we use several video feature extraction algorithms are proposed to test their possibilities to obtain differential data that can be useful to characterize different videos. All the different algorithms are divided throughput the exercise related to the features they aim to extract as follows:
- Histogram of Oriented Gradients
- Color and grayscale histograms
- Local Binary Patterns
- Text Detection
- Face Detection
- Deep Learning Object Detection
